# OOP-Final_Project
SPACESHOOTERS is a fast-paced space shooter game inspired by "Galaxy Attack." Built using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism, the game features animations powered by SFML. Inheritance allows for shared behaviors across different entities, such as the player and enemies, while polymorphism lets different weapons (like bullets and laser beams) be used interchangeably.
